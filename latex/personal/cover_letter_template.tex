\noindent
Dear Hiring Manager,
\bigskip

\noindent
Please accept my cover letter for the Scientist position at Philips. The
opportunity to work in image processing is attractive to me since I have
experience in this area. I would like to participate in the challenging
development of MR image processing utilities as well as to work with your
professional team.
\medskip

\noindent
I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree at Lappeenranta University of
Technology and have created a set of Matlab functions and routines to
calculate shadow areas using geographical elevation data.
\medskip

\noindent
During master studies I have been working with 3D point clouds, including the
use of Delaunay triangulation routine to compute certain features of those
points (Betti numbers). Later on I have earned experience in image processing
and camera/projector calibration with the help of Matlab and C++ libraries.
\medskip

\noindent
I enjoy coding and am always trying to produce the most clean, optimized and
reusable code. Obviously, the learning process never ends and I am eager to
develop my skills further specifically for MR image processing and creating
tools for better health analysis.\\ \medskip

\noindent
I thank you in advance for your consideration.\\\ \\

\noindent Sincerely,\\
Ivan Martynov
