  Software Developer (3D applications)

\noindent
Dear Hiring Manager,
\bigskip

\noindent
Please accept my cover letter for the Software Developer position at Visual
Components. The opportunity to work on a 3D engine is attractive since I enjoy
working with geometry. For nearly four years I have been working with 3D data devising algorithms
for geometrical properties of timber logs using the \Csharp\ language. Besides, I have
been learning how 3D
images on computers are created, because that is a very interesting subject and
I have a passion for learning things that fascinate me. As a hobby, I have
coded some OpenGL on my own to see what could be done with it.
\medskip

\noindent
For more than two years I have been doing code maintenance, that is bug fixing
and code refactoring. The main programming language was \CC\ and there is a lot
of old original code written in a C style language.
\medskip

\noindent
I have a mathematical background from the Petrozavodsk State University and have
acquired useful practical skills in the IT area at the Lappeenranta University of
Technology. Also I have done various courses on programming and, in particular,
Game Design, getting a hands-on experience with the Unity engine.
\medskip

\noindent
I have a \underline{\href{https://github.com/Ivan-Martynov}{github profile}} containing various code. The workspace repository
contains a lot of code, which is, most likely, not very comfortable to browse. However, there
is directory \verb|cpp/computer_graphics| which contains examples of OpenGL code.
Otherwise, you are welcome to browse through other code parts.
.\\ \medskip

\noindent
I thank you in advance for your consideration.\\\ \\

\noindent Sincerely,\\
Ivan Martynov
