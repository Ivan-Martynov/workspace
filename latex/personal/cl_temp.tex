Dear Hiring Manager,
\bigskip

\noindent
Please accept my cover letter for the Design Engineer position at ABB.
I would be happy to have a chance to work at ABB in the product development
chain and put my best effort to prove worth being part of the team.

I enjoy coding and I am always trying to produce the most clean, optimized and
reusable code. The C++ language strikes with its versatility and beauty and it
amuses me more than other languages. Obviously, the learning process never ends
and I am eager to develop my skills specifically for 3D graphics and continue
with such an experienced and respected company as ABB.

\noindent
I thank you in advance for your consideration.\\\ \\

\noindent Sincerely,\\
Ivan Martynov
