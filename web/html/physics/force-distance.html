  <h1> How Ramps and Wedges Make Heavy Things Easier to Move </h1>
  <p>
    In physics, tools like <strong> ramps </strong> and <strong>wedges</strong> are called <strong> simple machines </strong>. They don’t remove the need for work —
    instead, they help us do the same work in a smarter, easier way. </p>
  <h2> The Big Idea: Trading Force
    for
    Distance </h2>
  <p>
    Physics follows a rule called the <strong> work principle </strong>: </p>
  <div class="box">
    <strong> Work = Force× Distance </strong>
  </div>
  <p>
    To lift an object to a certain height, the total work needed is always the
    same.But we can change <em> how </em> we do that work. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use a <strong> large force </strong>
      over a
      <strong> short distance </strong>, or
    </li>
    <li>
      Use a <strong> small force </strong>
      over a
      <strong> long distance </strong>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p> Ramps and wedges
    let us choose the second option. </p>
  <h2> What a Ramp(Inclined Plane) Does </h2>
  <p>
    Imagine lifting a heavy object straight up onto a platform.That requires
    a big upward force. </p>
  <p>
    If you use a ramp instead, you push the object along a slope.The path is
    longer, but you don’ t have to push as hard. </p>
  <div class="box">
    <strong> Gentle ramp→ Less force needed, but more distance to push </strong><br />
    <strong> Steep ramp→ More force needed, but shorter distance </strong>
  </div>
  <p>
    A ramp reduces the force because only part of gravity pulls the object
    back down the slope, not the full weight all at once. </p>
  <h2> What a Wedge Does </h2>
  <p>
    A wedge is like two ramps placed back to back.When you push a wedge
    forward(like an axe splitting wood), the wedge turns your forward motion
    into strong sideways forces. </p>
  <p>
    You move the wedge a longer distance, and that produces a powerful force
    pushing materials apart. </p>
  <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2>
  <div class="box">
    Simple machines don’ t reduce the total work.They make hard tasks possible
    by spreading the work over a longer distance. </div>
  <p>
    This same idea is behind ramps, wedges, levers, pulleys, and screws.They
    all help us trade <strong> force </strong> for <strong>distance</strong> . </p>
