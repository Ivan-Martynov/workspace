Title: Slab [slăb, slæb]

Definition: A large, flat piece of solid material; a solid object that is large and flat. [noun]
Definition: The pitcher's rubber. [noun; baseball]
Definition: Thick; viscous; marshy. [adjective]

Origin: late 13c., "large, flat mass," of unknown origin, possibly related to Old French escopel, escalpe "thin fragment of wood," which according to Klein is possibly a Gaulish word (compare Breton scolp, Welsh ysgolp "splinter, chip"). But OED rejects this on formal grounds. Meaning "rectangular block of pre-cast concrete used in building" is from 1927. Slab-sided is "having flat sides like slabs," hence "tall and lank" (1817, American English). [noun]

Example: "She decided on a big slab of meat."
